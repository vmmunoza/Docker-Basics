# Introduction to Docker and Key Concepts

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications within lightweight and portable containers. It allows developers to package an application with all its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development, ensuring that it works seamlessly in any environment.

## Key Concepts of Docker

### Virtualization

Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources. It allows you to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine, with each VM sharing the resources of that one physical computer across multiple environments.

### Containers

Containers are lightweight, stand-alone, executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, but they share the OS kernel, binaries, and libraries, making them more efficient than VMs.

### Docker Images

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. Images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers - images become containers when they run on Docker Engine.

### Docker Engine

Docker Engine is the underlying client-server technology that builds and runs containers using Docker's components. The Docker Engine creates the Docker API, which is used by the Docker CLI (command line interface).

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services, networks, and volumes, and then create and start all the services from your configuration with a single command.

### Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using `docker build` users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

### Volumes

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker.

### Networks

In Docker, a network is a set of rules for how containers communicate with each other and the outside world. Docker provides different networking options to suit different needs.
